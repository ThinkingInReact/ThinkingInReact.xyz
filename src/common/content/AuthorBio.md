# About Author

I'm K-2052, a [developer](https://k2052.codes), stagnant [designer](http://dribble.com/k2052), [former shut-in](https://fightTheUrgeToFade.com) and occasional writer. I have written books on [Building Ruby Frameworks](http://buildYourOwnSinatra.com), [CoffeeScript frameworks](https://leanpub.com/building-coffeescript-frameworks) and a very [meta book on writing books](https://leanpub.com/markdown-to-ebook). I'm the author of a [Ruby Framework](https://github.com/eldr-rb/eldr) and a [CoffeeScript Framework](https://github.com/ryggrad).

I'm on a never ending quest for programming enlightenment. A quest that has taken me from the predictable waters of C to the foreign lands of LISP, through deserts where OCamls and Monads roam, through the declarative plains, past the swamps of imperative, into the great unknowns of FRP.

When not on [twitter](https://twitter.com/k_2052) running parody accounts I can be found not finishing projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/k2052).
