Have you ever looked outside, realized it is sunny and thought "omg I wish I had planned to go to the lake today"? ReactiveWeather allows you to plan out your future dependent on what happens weather wise. If it gets sunny and you like run through creep forests on sunny days it will remind you to go for a jog! You thought we had enough todo and weather apps, but you were wrong! We just needed to combine them!
