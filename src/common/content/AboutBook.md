# About The Book

When you first encounter React it is like playing. We get hot reload, unidirectional data flow, inline styles, JSX and fancy demos that make everything seem awesome. But when we set out our own we can be quickly overwhelmed. Our heads quickly get filled with questions like; How do I use jQuery libs with this? How do I animate things? Do I use props or state for this? What is the difference between props and state anyway? Wait, why are my input values not changing? It is easily to feel like; "I'm just going back to Backbone and jQuery, forget this stuff"

I learned to program in 2004 on Macromedia Flash MX. Flash was amazing _\*shudders\*_ and easy! Everything I needed was right there; all I had to do was add a script and hit "run". In seconds, there would be action on my screen! I could make anything happen! I could build anything! WORLDS WITHIN WORLDS!

Flash wasn't a simple tool; rich and complex applications took a herculean effort to create. What flash was, was easy. Flash let you instantly get up and running and to see what you were building. There were no task runners, no package managers to install, no frameworks to learn or build systems to master. You wrote code and then pressed "run"

Later on, I learned HTML, CSS, and JS. This was even easier! I could write my app in a simple text editor and open it any browser! With JavaScript, I could add all sorts of cool things! Buttons that clicked! Elements that toggled -- that flew around the page and generally drove users insane! It was all so easy and all it took was a browser and a text editor!

Somehow we lost that ease. Knowing your language is no longer enough, you have to become a master of your build tools, your editors, your package managers, your framework's abstractions. MVC, two-way bindings, class constructors, MVVM, compile to JS and Backbone collections and virtual DOMS and syncing engines and on and on. It is no wonder people become obsessed with their chosen stacks, it takes obsession to master them.

React is a philosophical rejection of all these abstractions. It is a realization that with the right technological foundations easy is possible. In React we simply declare what we want and React handles the rest! Patterns, abstractions, frameworks, and complicated libs replaced by better technology.

With the simplicity of React, the abstractions we think of as just part of web development become unnecessary. Instead of binding our HTML elements through a bunch of ceremonial hookups, we can just continually pass our new data into React components and React figures out what changed. Instead of views, controllers, and models, we have just Components and State. Instead of being forced to spread state out across modules, functions, controllers, views, models and more; we get one central source.

React changes the way you think. React turns complex problems into non-issues and lets you get back to building things. Most of the ideas that React has spawned like unidirectional data flow, immutable data stores, redux etc, are not just an accident, they are the logical development of rendering things declaratively.

It is hard to think easy. It easy to fall back into old ways of thinking and do away with all the power that React gives us. Instead of unleashing the full potential of React, React becomes just a new fancy view layer we (often angrily) try to force into our old apps. Instead of being fun, React becomes a chore.

This book is about solving old problems in new React ways. You will learn how to implement all the things you have encountered a thousand times before but in dramatically simpler ways. You will learn how to build and implement everything from forms to sliders to dialogs to validation to server syncing and animated buttons. You will learn to _think in React_.
